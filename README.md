## GATSBY-FLYER-STARTER

# THIS IS AN ALPHA VERSION OF THIS PROJECT

### TODO

- [ ] Replace logo on on main menu
- [ ] Replace logo on hero section
- [ ] Replace hero image (even if in Git)
- [ ] Update Subhead titling
- [ ] Be able to upload new images for bags and uprdate blurbs
- [ ] Be able to upload new call outs and blurbs
- [ ] Add links to newsletter and contact buttons at bottom.

### NOTES

- when uploading a Logo, also upload a <white> version
- currently, without a more complicated version of the flyer-starter
  editing footer and navbar contents will require chanes to
  config.js variables in the project root folder

### CREATING A FLYER FROM THE STARTER

- clone the repo to your workstation
- `cd gatsby-flyer-starter`
- `git branch <new-flyer-name>`
- `git checkout <new-flyer-name>`
  you are now in the branch you created for the new flyer and you can edit as necessary
- you will need to edit config.js
- you will also need to edit static/admin/config.yml
  only the branch name needs to be edited, change it to the name of the branch you just created
- the new flyer will have equine advantage as a place holder you can edit content in the CMS

### NETLIFY

You will need to set up new netlify for the flyer and give it a nice name
other than what netlify generates (although some of the nelify names are fun!)
